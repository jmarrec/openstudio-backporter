A small library to backport an [OpenStudio](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio) OSM model to an older version.
I am only added backports as old as I need to.

A Jupyter Notebook [openstudio-backporter_Demonstration.ipynb](openstudio-backporter_Demonstration.ipynb) can serve as a small demonstration of the features.
